This project is based on breast cancer diagnostic dataset of various patients from Kaggle for predictive analysis.
It is a classification problem and our goal is to predict the type of tumor whether it is benign or malignant based on other given data. 
Here, Random Forest Algorithm and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) are used in R for the predictions.
There are 31 columns in the dataset which contain the following: 

id	diagnosis	radius_mean	texture_mean	perimeter_mean	area_mean	smoothness_mean	  compactness_mean	concavity_mean	concave points_mean	symmetry_mean	fractal_dimension_mean	radius_se	texture_se	perimeter_se	area_se	smoothness_se	compactness_se	concavity_se	concave points_se	symmetry_se	fractal_dimension_se	radius_worst	texture_worst	perimeter_worst	area_worst	smoothness_worst	compactness_worst	concavity_worst	concave points_worst	symmetry_worst	fractal_dimension_worst
